{"message":"closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `list`, which is owned by the current function","code":{"code":"E0373","explanation":"A captured variable in a closure may not live long enough.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(|y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nThis error occurs when an attempt is made to use data captured by a closure,\nwhen that data may no longer exist. It's most commonly seen when attempting to\nreturn a closure as shown in the previous code example.\n\nNotice that `x` is stack-allocated by `foo()`. By default, Rust captures\nclosed-over data by reference. This means that once `foo()` returns, `x` no\nlonger exists. An attempt to access `x` within the closure would thus be\nunsafe.\n\nAnother situation where this might be encountered is when spawning threads:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373\nfn foo() {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    let y = 1u32;\n\n    let thr = std::thread::spawn(|| {\n        x + y\n    });\n}\n```\n\nSince our new thread runs in parallel, the stack frame containing `x` and `y`\nmay well have disappeared by the time we try to use them. Even if we call\n`thr.join()` within foo (which blocks until `thr` has completed, ensuring the\nstack frame won't disappear), we will not succeed: the compiler cannot prove\nthat this behavior is safe, and so won't let us do it.\n\nThe solution to this problem is usually to switch to using a `move` closure.\nThis approach moves (or copies, where possible) data into the closure, rather\nthan taking references to it. For example:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> Box<Fn(u32) -> u32> {\n    let x = 0u32;\n    Box::new(move |y| x + y)\n}\n```\n\nNow that the closure has its own copy of the data, there's no need to worry\nabout safety.\n\nThis error may also be encountered while using `async` blocks:\n\n```compile_fail,E0373,edition2018\nuse std::future::Future;\n\nasync fn f() {\n    let v = vec![1, 2, 3i32];\n    spawn(async { //~ ERROR E0373\n        println!(\"{:?}\", v)\n    });\n}\n\nfn spawn<F: Future + Send + 'static>(future: F) {\n    unimplemented!()\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly to closures, `async` blocks are not executed immediately and may\ncapture closed-over data by reference.
